Overall Experience:
I think this was a very interesting and fun final project. This project allowed us to have a lot of freedom within the project itself. I really enjoyed the process of learning and developing an app and really found the process of trying to test out the app is really cool. 

Difficulties:
It was difficult learning the new language of Swift and how some things were both different and similar to Python. It was also difficult coding using XCode because you couldn't code at the same time as the other people in my group since it would make it run slow and a lot of pop-ups would occur which would make it more difficult to make changes. Another problem that we faced was the syntax erros. There was a lot of syntax errors while running the code since we were new to the language. There was also some errors with the app crashing, so we needed to figure out where the issue occurred and then had to figure out how to fix the code.

What I learned:
Something that I learned throughout the whole process was that learning a new language on your own can be challenging, but if you put time into it, the more you stick with it, the easier everything becomes. I also just learned more about XCode and Swift in general and how apps generally run and the overall process of creating apps using a lot of separate files.
